You can put as much or as little effort into this (and this could also be helpful in building your side project portfolio), but don''t save it until the last minute because it is definitely time consuming. Pick a good group. His lectures are basically a repeat of the slides he uploads online. In my opinion, the textbook will definitely be your best friend. There is one midterm and a final exam. Both are open notes, open book, etc. You can use your laptop (no Google-ing but you can use the course website to look at notes) and if you have the textbook, you can easily CTRL-F for the topics, etc. during the exams. Do the extra credit for each homework assignment because they aren''t terribly difficult and it''s definitely your best grade booster. You learn a lot about the back-end, but you need to be very passionate about databases not to be bored every lecture. Lastly, the grading is very fair and the professor is really nice & understanding. He''s a little monotone in lecture, but he''s very willing to help students and very passionate about the subject. The UTAs are sometimes very aloof/not consistent with office hours so I really suggest going to Jun''s office hours if you need any clarification/help.'),

    (41,'Fall 2014',4.0,5.0,'Easiness: This class is by no means easy. Your final grade is determined by two midterms and a final exam, all of which are very difficult. Fullenkamp’s tests are tricky, and the top scores normally fall in the 50-70% range. Workload: Not that much work – one problem set a week, though the problem set is very difficult and sometimes rather lengthy. Fullenkamp only checks for completion, though, so no worries about doing everything completely accurately.
Comments: While the class does not require a lot of work on the surface, it is very hard to do well, given how large the class size is and how tough Fullenkamp likes to make the course. Regardless, it is still possible to get an A/B+ (he curves somewhat generously), but only if you put in a lot of effort outside of class to really understand the concepts. I would also encourage meeting with him one-on-one – he’s a lot less intimidating and a lot more helpful than he is in lecture.'),

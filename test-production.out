        29 | Fall 2019 |                5 |          3 | Awesome instructor, take it with him. Workload is not too much, only 4 assignments per semester + final project. Grading is fair, no curve though. Solid material, practical in real life.
        30 | Fall 2019 |                5 |          3 | Professor is good at explaining the material!The homework is helpful to understand the concept and the tests are reasonable
